        <h2>A safe space to find a safe place.</h2>

        <p>
          After the U.S. Supreme Court officially reversed Roe v Wade in June of
          2022, millions lost a fundamental constitutional protection, the right
          to abortion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roe’dToAid was created to bring awareness and expand access to safe,
          authorized clinics that provide necessary healthcare to all birthers.
          This application compiles current clinic information by state and
          clearly defines authorized clinics and distinguishes them from
          misinformation centers. Users can learn about current state policies
          as well as available resources in their state.
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
